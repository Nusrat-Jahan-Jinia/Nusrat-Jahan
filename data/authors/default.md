I am a software engineer working on web applications and web infrastructure. I
have been developing professionally for 7 years and I started in tech with internships, freelance services, and part-time positions during university.

A day in my life consists of:preparing web art, ﬁxing front-end bugs, adding an
API endpoint, database design, conﬁguring a unit or unit test library, setting up a
deployment plan, and execute it with the team.
